Simply clone & add this project to a Java-compatible IDE.

I configured for "app development" settings but it should not matter.

Build & run-- edit main to test different results/commands. Can comment and un-comment them.

Suggestions:

More clarity as to whether the function signatures have to be followed exactly etc. might be helpful.
In addition, I would prefer there be a script written to test (or set outputs that have to be shown) so the criteria are really clear.
Finally, if there was one prescribed language to use, then it might be easier to auto-grade.
